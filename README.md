# Open Signal Intelligence
# Signal Intelligence Project for bb60c and USRP X Series

## Project Features


## Signal Detection and Processing

- Auto Signal Detection: Implement an automated system to detect signals.
- Manual GUI Tool: A GUI tool for users to manually adjust the bounding boxes of detected signals.
- Signal Listing: After detecting, create a list of all signals detected.
- IQ Data Recording: Record IQ data for each detected signal.

## Visualization

- Waterfall and FFT Plots: Automatically save these plots as images.
	- High-Res Mode: Capture plots in high resolution.
	- Fast Sweep Mode: Quick scanning and plotting of signals.

## GUI and Decoding

- Interactive GUI: Once GUI is set up, users can click on signals.
	- Auto Decoder Detection using AI: AI system to predict and apply appropriate decoders for signals.

## Additional Features

- Harmonics Mode: Analyze and display harmonics of the detected signals.
- FCC Database Overlay Mode: Overlay detected signals with FCC database entries for reference.

## Note on Decoders

Decoders are incomplete as of yet we need to finish them they are basically just primer scripts to get you started.

## Key Objective: The ability to automatically detect decoders and frequencies is of utmost importance.
